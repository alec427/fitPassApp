This is a simple web application made with MEAN stack.
There are two panels in the home page, the left one is a simple user creation where you can see your information and logout and the one in the right checks if the email address you enter is registered with fitpass. If possible view the app in a laptop/desktop since its not fully responsive. The passwords are encrypted with bcrypt and authentication is safely executed with passport.

To run the web app locally do the following:

1.- Clone this repo to your computer

2.- Open the terminal and open two tabs

3.- In the first tab open the client folder and run [ npm i -S ]

4.- In the second tab open the server folder and run [ npm i -S ]

5.- Once you have both folders installed and open, type [ npm start ] in the server folder and [ ng serve ] in the client folder

6.- Open your browser and go to [ localhost:4200 ] 

7.- You're good to go! Create your user on the left and check if you are registered on the right.

8.- Have fun!
